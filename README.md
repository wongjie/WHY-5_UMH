## Description
Our project, ScreenPRO, combines a website application with a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for efficient data extraction. 

## Features
**Website Application**  
Our website includes a Dashboard featuring recommendations of Shariah-Compliant companies for easy access, along with a News Section delivering the latest developments and trends. The main function is the Report generator where users can generate screening reports by uploading the companies'audited report. There is a Repository that provides access to companies' annual reports and audited accounts. The About section offers insights into Shariah-Compliant criteria, a user guide, and personalized profile settings.

**spaCy NER Model**  
The spaCy NER Model leverages the 'en_core_web_lg' pre-trained model from the spaCy NLP library. It provides transparency and cost-free capabilities. It is highly customizable for domain-specific data labeling needs that ensures efficiency and delivers reliable results without imposing high computational costs.
